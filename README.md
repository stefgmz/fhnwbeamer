## School options
The 'school' option sets the right logo. It is necessary to download the required
logos from https://www.fhnw.ch/de/medien/logos.

## Language options
The language of the letter depends on the language which is loaded
with the babel package. If both, English and German, are loaded,
then the language will default to German.

## TODO
- [ ] Include different institutes
- [x] More schools
- [ ] Case subtitle + author
